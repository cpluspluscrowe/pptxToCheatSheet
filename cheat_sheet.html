Single object classes are too detailed and specific.</div><div>	Components are more abstract than object classes and can be considered to be stand-alone service providers. They can exist as stand-alone entities.</div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	3</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>CBSE essentials</div><div>	Independent components specified by their interfaces.</div><div>	Component standards to facilitate component integration.</div><div>	Middleware that provides support for component inter-operability.</div><div>	A development process that is geared to reuse.</div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	4</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>CBSE and design principles</div><div>	Apart from the benefits of reuse, CBSE is based on sound software engineering design principles:</div><div>		Components are independent so do not interfere with each other;</div><div>		Component implementations are hidden;</div><div>		Communication is through well-defined interfaces;</div><div>		One components can be replaced by another if its interface is maintained;</div><div>		Component infrastructures offer a range of standard services.</div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	5</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>Component standards</div><div>	Standards need to be established so that components can communicate with each other and inter-operate.</div><div>	Unfortunately, several competing component standards were established:</div><div>		Sun’s Enterprise Java Beans</div><div>		Microsoft’s COM and .NET</div><div>		CORBA’s CCM</div><div>	In practice, these multiple standards have hindered the uptake of CBSE. It is impossible for components developed using different approaches to work together. </div><div>		</div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	6</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>Service-oriented software engineering</div><div>	An executable service is a type of independent component. It has a ‘provides’ interface but not a ‘requires’ interface.</div><div>	From the outset, services have been based around standards so there are no problems in communicating between services offered by different vendors.</div><div>	System performance may be slower with services but this approach is replacing CBSE in many systems.</div><div>	Covered in Chapter 18</div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	7</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>Components and component models</div><div>	</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	8</div><div>Components</div><div>	Components provide a service without regard to where the component is executing or its programming language</div><div>		A component is an independent executable entity that can be made up of one or more executable objects;</div><div>		The component interface is published and all interactions are through the published interface;</div><div>	</div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	9</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>Component definitions</div><div>	Councill and Heinmann:</div><div>		A software component is a software element that conforms to a component model and can be independently deployed and composed without modification according to a composition standard.</div><div>	Szyperski:</div><div>		A software component is a unit of composition with contractually specified interfaces and explicit context dependencies only. A software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third-parties.</div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	10</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>Component characteristics </div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	11</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>Component characteristics </div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	12</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>Component as a service provider</div><div>	The component is an independent, executable entity. It does not have to be compiled before it is used with other components.</div><div>	The services offered by a component are made available through an interface and all component interactions take place through that interface.</div><div>	The component interface is expressed in terms of parameterized operations and its internal state is never exposed. </div><div>	</div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	13</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>Component interfaces</div><div>	Provides interface</div><div>		Defines the services that are provided by the component to other components.</div><div>		This interface, essentially, is the component API. It defines the methods that can be called by a user of the component. </div><div>	Requires interface</div><div>		Defines the services that specifies what services must be made available for the component to execute as specified.</div><div>		This does not compromise the independence or deployability of a component because the ‘requires’ interface does not define how these services should be provided. </div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	14</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>Component interfaces </div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	15</div><div>	Note UML notation.

This may put off potential users of the component.</div><div>		The operation of the component may depend on local exception handling, and changing this may have serious implications for the functionality of the component.</div><div>	</div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	30</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>Legacy system components</div><div>	Existing legacy systems that fulfil a useful business function can be re-packaged as components for reuse.</div><div>	This involves writing a wrapper component that implements provides and requires interfaces then accesses the legacy system.</div><div>	Although costly, this can be much less expensive than rewriting the legacy system.</div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	31</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>Reusable components</div><div>	The development cost of reusable components may be higher than the cost of specific equivalents. This extra reusability enhancement cost should be an organization rather than a project cost.</div><div>	Generic components may be less space-efficient and may have longer execution times than their specific equivalents.</div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	32</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>Component management</div><div>	Component management involves deciding how to classify the component so that it can be discovered, making the component available either in a repository or as a service, maintaining information about the use of the component and keeping track of different component versions. </div><div>	A company with a reuse program may carry out some form of component certification before the component is made available for reuse. </div><div>		Certification means that someone apart from the developer checks the quality of the component. </div><div>	</div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	33</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>CBSE with reuse</div><div>	CBSE with reuse process has to find and integrate reusable components.</div><div>	When reusing components, it is essential to make trade-offs between ideal requirements and the services actually provided by available components.</div><div>	This involves:</div><div>		Developing outline requirements;</div><div>		Searching for components then modifying requirements according to available functionality.</div><div>		Searching again to find if there are better components that meet the revised requirements.</div><div>		Composing components to create the system.</div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	34</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>CBSE with reuse </div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	35</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>The component identification process </div><div>	Chapter 16 Component-based software engineering</div><div>	36</div><div>	19/11/2014</div><div>Component identification issues</div><div>	Trust.
