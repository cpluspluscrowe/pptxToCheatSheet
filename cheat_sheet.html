You need to be able to trust the supplier of a component. At best, an untrusted component may not operate as advertised; at worst, it can breach your security.</div><div></tab>&emsp;Requirements.

How can you test this will not interfere with your application?</div></div><div><div><b>Component interfaces</b></div><div></tab>&emsp;Provides interface</div><div></tab>&emsp;Defines the services that are provided by the component to other components.</div><div></tab>&emsp;This interface, essentially, is the component API. It defines the methods that can be called by a user of the component. </div><div></tab>&emsp;Requires interface</div><div></tab>&emsp;Defines the services that specifies what services must be made available for the component to execute as specified.</div><div></tab>&emsp;This does not compromise the independence or deployability of a component because the ‘requires’ interface does not define how these services should be provided. </div></div><div><div><b>Component interfaces </b></div><div></tab>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Note UML notation. Ball and sockets can fit together.</div></div><div><div><b>Component management</b></div><div></tab>&emsp;Component management involves deciding how to classify the component so that it can be discovered, making the component available either in a repository or as a service, maintaining information about the use of the component and keeping track of different component versions. </div><div></tab>&emsp;A company with a reuse program may carry out some form of component certification before the component is made available for reuse. </div><div></tab>&emsp;Certification means that someone apart from the developer checks the quality of the component. </div></div><div><div><b>Component models</b></div><div></tab>&emsp;A component model is a definition of standards for component implementation, documentation and deployment.</div><div></tab>&emsp;Examples of component models</div><div></tab>&emsp;EJB model (Enterprise Java Beans)</div><div></tab>&emsp;COM+ model (.NET model)</div><div></tab>&emsp;Corba Component Model</div><div></tab>&emsp;The component model specifies how interfaces should be defined and the elements that should be included in an interface definition.</div></div><div><div><b>Component standards</b></div><div></tab>&emsp;Standards need to be established so that components can communicate with each other and inter-operate.</div><div></tab>&emsp;Unfortunately, several competing component standards were established:</div><div></tab>&emsp;Sun’s Enterprise Java Beans</div><div></tab>&emsp;Microsoft’s COM and .NET</div><div></tab>&emsp;CORBA’s CCM</div><div></tab>&emsp;In practice, these multiple standards have hindered the uptake of CBSE. It is impossible for components developed using different approaches to work together. </div></div><div><div><b>Component validation </b></div><div></tab>&emsp;Component validation involves developing a set of test cases for a component (or, possibly, extending test cases supplied with that component) and developing a test harness to run component tests. </div><div></tab>&emsp;The major problem with component validation is that the component specification may not be sufficiently detailed to allow you to develop a complete set of component tests. </div><div></tab>&emsp;As well as testing that a component for reuse does what you require, you may also have to check that the component does not include any malicious code or functionality that you don’t need. </div></div><div><div><b>Component-based development</b></div><div></tab>&emsp;Component-based software engineering (CBSE) is an approach to software development that relies on the reuse of entities called ‘software components’.</div><div></tab>&emsp;It emerged from the failure of object-oriented development to support effective reuse. Single object classes are too detailed and specific.</div><div></tab>&emsp;Components are more abstract than object classes and can be considered to be stand-alone service providers.

This has to be globally unique.</div><div></tab>&emsp;Deployment </div><div></tab>&emsp;The component model includes a specification of how components should be packaged for deployment as independent, executable entities.  </div></div><div><div><b>Exception handling</b></div><div></tab>&emsp;Components should not handle exceptions themselves, because each application will have its own requirements for exception handling. </div><div></tab>&emsp;Rather, the component should define what exceptions can arise and should publish these as part of the interface.</div><div></tab>&emsp;In practice, however, there are two problems with this:</div><div></tab>&emsp;Publishing all exceptions leads to bloated interfaces that are harder to understand. This may put off potential users of the component.</div><div></tab>&emsp;The operation of the component may depend on local exception handling, and changing this may have serious implications for the functionality of the component.</div></div><div><div><b>Glue code</b></div><div></tab>&emsp;Code that allows components to work together</div><div></tab>&emsp;If A and B are composed sequentially, then glue code has to call A, collect its results then call B using these results, transforming them into the format required by B.</div><div></tab>&emsp;Glue code may be used to resolve interface incompatibilities.</div></div><div><div><b>Interface incompatibility</b></div><div></tab>&emsp;Parameter incompatibility where operations have the same name but are of different types.</div><div></tab>&emsp;Operation incompatibility where the names of operations in the composed interfaces are different.</div><div></tab>&emsp;Operation incompleteness where the provides interface of one component is a subset of the requires interface of another.</div></div><div><div><b>Interface semantics</b></div><div></tab>&emsp;You have to rely on component documentation to decide if interfaces that are syntactically compatible are actually compatible.</div><div></tab>&emsp;Consider an interface for a PhotoLibrary component:</div></div><div><div><b>Key points</b></div><div></tab>&emsp;During the CBSE process, the processes of requirements engineering and system design are interleaved.</div><div></tab>&emsp;Component composition is the process of ‘wiring’ components together to create a system.</div><div></tab>&emsp;When composing reusable components, you normally have to write adaptors to reconcile different component interfaces.</div><div></tab>&emsp;When choosing compositions, you have to consider required functionality, non-functional requirements and system evolution.</div></div><div><div><b>Legacy system components</b></div><div></tab>&emsp;Existing legacy systems that fulfil a useful business function can be re-packaged as components for reuse.</div><div></tab>&emsp;This involves writing a wrapper component that implements provides and requires interfaces then accesses the legacy system.</div><div></tab>&emsp;Although costly, this can be much less expensive than rewriting the legacy system.</div></div><div><div><b>Middleware services defined in a component model </b></div></div><div><div><b>Middleware support</b></div><div></tab>&emsp;Component models are the basis for middleware that provides support for executing components.</div><div></tab>&emsp;Component model implementations provide:</div><div></tab>&emsp;Platform services that allow components written according to the model to communicate;</div><div></tab>&emsp;Support services that are application-independent services used by different components.</div><div></tab>&emsp;To use services provided by a model, components are deployed in a container.
